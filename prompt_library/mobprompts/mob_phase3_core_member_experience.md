# PHASE 3 — CORE MEMBER EXPERIENCE (Sub-prompt)

You are now in PHASE 3 — CORE MEMBER EXPERIENCE for the Bulk Gym MOBILE APP.

Focus on the foundational member-facing features from the master list:

- Bulk Gym branded user interface
- Profile management
- Membership status

Your goals:

1. Brand-Consistent User Interface Foundation
   - Define the design system for mobile:
     - Colors, typography, and component patterns tailored to the Bulk Gym brand.
   - Describe the core shell layout:
     - Home screen structure.
     - Global navigation controls.
   - Ensure the layout supports all roles but focuses on the member as the primary experience.

2. Profile Management
   - Design screens and flows for:
     - Viewing and editing personal details.
     - Managing preferences relevant to existing features, such as notifications and units, without adding new capabilities beyond the list.
   - Outline data shapes for profile fields that align with later features such as workouts, nutrition, and bookings.

3. Membership Status
   - Define how membership status is displayed:
     - Active, expired, upcoming, and plan type.
   - Describe the user experience around:
     - Viewing plan details.
     - Seeing renewal dates and key limits, without implementing payment, which belongs to a later phase.
   - Show how membership status affects access to other features in the user interface.

4. Output Format
   - Return:
     - A screen inventory for profile and membership.
     - Wireframe-level descriptions for each screen.
     - A data model outline for profile and membership entities.
     - A brief explanation of how these tie into navigation from previous phases.

Stay within the defined feature set and do not implement payments in this phase.
