# PHASE 5 — TRAINING, WORKOUTS, AND PROGRESS (Sub-prompt)

You are now in PHASE 5 — TRAINING, WORKOUTS, AND PROGRESS for the Bulk Gym MOBILE APP.

Focus on these master features:

- Workout plans and exercise library with video
- Progress tracking
- Challenges, badges, and leaderboards

Your goals:

1. Workout Plans and Exercise Library
   - Design:
     - How members browse and follow workout plans.
     - Exercise library user interface, including video playback.
   - Clarify:
     - How trainers assign or recommend plans via mobile when applicable.
     - How plans are structured with blocks, days, exercises, sets, and reps without adding new features beyond what is required to express plans.

2. Progress Tracking
   - Define:
     - Which metrics are tracked, such as weights, reps, completed workouts, and body metrics.
     - How progress is visualized, including charts, streaks, and completion rates.
   - Ensure:
     - The model supports future AI recommendations and challenges.

3. Challenges, Badges, and Leaderboards
   - Design:
     - Types of challenges based on existing workout and progress data.
     - Badge system with trigger conditions and display user experience.
     - Leaderboards, such as top performers or most consistent members, without turning this into a full social network beyond the master list.

4. Output Format
   - Return:
     - A screen list for workouts, exercises, and progress.
     - A challenge, badge, and leaderboard specification describing rules and user interface.
     - A data model outline for plans, exercises, logs, and gamification elements.

Keep strictly within the master feature list and avoid introducing unrelated tracking or social features.
