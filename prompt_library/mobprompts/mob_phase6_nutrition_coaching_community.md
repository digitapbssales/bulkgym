- Community feed
- Live and recorded workout classes

Your goals:

1. Nutrition Plans and Macros

     - How nutrition progress is reflected without introducing new tracking outside the scope.

2. In-App Chat Between Member and Trainer
   - Define:
     - One-to-one chat flows between members and trainers.
     - Basic features such as read statuses and simple attachments when needed for workouts or nutrition while respecting storage constraints.
   - Consider:
     - Realtime capabilities through Supabase.
     - How chat ties into workout and nutrition coaching.

3. Community Feed
   - Design:
     - A feed where members can see community posts relevant to the gym.
     - Content types that stay consistent with existing features, such as accomplishments, challenges, and announcements.
   - Avoid:
     - Building a fully general-purpose social network.

4. Live and Recorded Workout Classes

     - How live classes are surfaced and joined from the app.
     - How recorded classes are discovered and played.
   - Clarify:
     - How classes relate to existing class schedules and bookings.

5. Output Format

     - A screen list and flows for nutrition, chat, community, and live and recorded classes.
     - A data model outline for messages, posts, and nutrition entities.
     - A short explanation of how realtime and offline behavior is handled.
