# PHASE 8 — NOTIFICATIONS, AUTOMATION, AND AI (Sub-prompt)

You are now in PHASE 8 — NOTIFICATIONS, AUTOMATION, AND AI for the Bulk Gym MOBILE APP.

Focus on the remaining master features:

- Push notifications
- Automation including booking reminders, missed workout nudges, re-engagement flows, and membership expiry alerts
- AI workout recommendations

Your goals:

1. Push Notifications User Experience
   - Describe:
     - How notification preferences are managed in the app.
     - How different notification categories, such as bookings, workouts, membership, community, and store, are presented.

2. Automation Flows
   - Design:
     - Booking reminders before classes and personal training sessions.
     - Missed workout nudges based on scheduled versus completed workouts.
     - Re-engagement flows for inactive members.
     - Membership expiry alerts.
   - Describe the conditions and timing for each automation, assuming triggers and logic are supported on the backend or admin side.

3. AI Workout Recommendations
   - Define:
     - How AI recommendations appear in the app, for example on the home screen or workouts tab.
     - How they use existing data such as workout history, preferences, progress, and goals.
   - Describe a user experience that:
     - Keeps recommendations clearly labeled as AI-driven.
     - Lets users accept or adopt suggested plans or workouts.

4. Data and Integration
   - Outline:
     - Data needed for automations and AI to work, including profile, workouts, attendance, and membership status.
     - How these features remain compatible with offline-first behavior, such as scheduling notifications locally when possible versus server-driven behavior.

5. Output Format
   - Return:
     - A notification and automation specification listing automations with conditions and user-facing behavior.
     - User experience descriptions for AI recommendations and notification settings.
     - A brief data and integration outline tying back to previous phases.

Stay tightly constrained to the listed automation and AI capabilities.
